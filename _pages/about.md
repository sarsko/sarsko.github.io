## Hi!

I'm Sarek.

I currently work as an Applied Scientist in the S3 Automated Reasoning Group (S3-ARG), where I do Rust and model checking and stuff. It's a lot of fun. 

Before I joined S3-ARG, I did a pretty good [Master's thesis](SarekSkotåm_thesis.pdf) (best thesis I ever wrote, at least. It also won the Norwegian Computing Central [**best thesis award**](https://nr.no/2023/03/15/vinnere-av-nr-prisen-2022/#sarekskot%C3%A5m), which is really cool.). It is about a selection of
[SAT solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_solver) which I wrote in Rust, and then verified
with [Creusot](https://github.com/xldenis/creusot). The source code of the solvers is available in
the [CreuSAT](https://github.com/sarsko/CreuSAT) repository.


I am interested in most things programming &mdash; especially those which have a "pain in brain" feeling. Previously that need
has been satisfied by things like C and CUDA, and recently it has been satisfied by Rust and formal methods, which I believe I
will remain interested in for the foreseeable future.

There is also some more information about me in my [CV](CV_SarekSkotåm.pdf).

If you think I have written or said or done something stupid or smart or wrong, or you want to contact me for some other reason, then
you can reach my by [mail](mailto:sarek.skotam@gmail.com), or send me a
message on the [Rust Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/).
