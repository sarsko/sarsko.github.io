A year ago I had done exactly zero program proofs.

I have now done more than zero program proofs, and have, in my opinion, become pretty good at doing program proofs in Creusot.

I have therefore, with the intention to make the transition from having done zero proofs to being able to prove useful programs in Creusot a little bit less
painful, written up some of my learnings. There is probably a bunch of things which I once found hard, and then understood, and now have forgotten that is hard,
so feel free to reach out to me or Xavier Denis or open a [issue](https://github.com/xldenis/creusot/issues) or something if you're struggling.

This is in no way a complete guide, but I think the current [test suite](https://github.com/xldenis/creusot/tree/master/creusot/tests/should_succeed) of Creusot
combined with these writings, my [thesis](SarekSkot√•m_thesis.pdf), and the proofs found in [CreuSAT](https://github.com/sarsko/CreuSAT), should make the experience
of learning Creusot a lot less shit than it used to be.

Also, Creusot has become a stupid amount better since I started. I now has a lot fewer rough edges, support for more features, and is able to prove things much
more easily.
